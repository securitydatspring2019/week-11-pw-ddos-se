# Week 11 - Passwords

## Social Engineering

## Social Engineering and Denial of Service
In this class we will look at two subjects,
namely Social Engineering and Denial of Service attacks.
The first subject is about to gain information,
from people using social skills,
as a the way in contrast to traditional hacking,
that uses code.
The second is about how to make a service unavailable,
normally by attacking it with heavy traffic and means to avoid such attacks

## Learning Goals

After this week you will:

* Know different ways to use Social Engineering
* Know ways to detect social engineering attemts
* Know the most common DoS strategies
* Know common means to minimize threads of DoS

## Handling passwords and secrets

### Read/Watch

- Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cmuiTBZVs) to get a bacis idea about handling passwords, and the BCrypt algorithm
- Read this [article](http://dustwell.com/how-to-handle-passwords-bcrypt.html) to get a better understanding
- Skim this [article]() to see that size/complexity of the keys/secrets used to sign cookies, JSON Web Token etc. MATTERS. Read the section "Prevention"
- Read this article [Protecting Secrets in Use](https://www.unboundtech.com/protecting-secrets-in-use-the-long-version/)
- Skim this articles related to handling credit card info [PCI DSS Quick Reference Guide](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI%20SSC%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)
